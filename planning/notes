When including header files it is tempting to have one file that includes all the other ones you will be using but this have multiple drawbacks.
It is good to see in the beginning of each source file what headers it is using to get an idea of what types and signatures are present.
Less translation modules will have to be built when changing a header since only a subset will be affected.
Headers and source files should only include headers they make use of.
